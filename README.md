# BiteBlitz Food Ordering Website


BiteBlitz is a food ordering website developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It features a user-friendly interface for ordering food items, a secure login/signup system, and a smooth checkout process. The website stores user and order data in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Login/Signup:** Users can create an account or log in using their credentials.
- **Food Ordering:** Browse through a variety of food items displayed in cards and add them to the cart.
- **Shopping Cart:** View and manage items in the cart before proceeding to checkout.
- **Secure Checkout:** Enter delivery details and complete the order securely.
- **Database Integration:** User and order data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user and order data.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
